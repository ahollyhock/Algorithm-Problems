#Algorithms and Interview Prep Guide 

## Getting Started

This guide will help you to prepare and host an algorithm and interview prep meetup in your local region.  

## Tools and Resources
	* Online invitation (ex. [http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-SF/events/203354282/])
	* Location:
		An office space with enough rooms or space to host 3+ groups in the same time (The algorithm video/discuss class, the white board group practice (mini-groups are divided by specific language) and the behavioral/values interview prep questions/answer) 
	* White Boards 
	* Projector
    * Speaker system
    * Algorithm exercises website (ex. [http://meetupresources.herokuapp.com/index.html])
    * Interview Questions samples: (ex. [http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~kelu/interviews/questions.html])

## Group Division
	* The algorithm video/discuss class
	* The white board group practice (mini-groups are divided by specific language
    * The behavioral/values interview prep questions/answer

 + (*)This format is also very friendly to drop in attendees who are unable to join every week or to people who need to drop out from the group for a time due to other commitments but want to rejoin at any point in the future without feeling too left behind.

## Online Invitation Sample:

This weekly meetup will cover whiteboarding, interview questions, pair programming, and the regularly scheduled algorithms study group will now be covering MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS -- starting this week! 

6:30 Arrival/food

7:00 Welcome and Kickoff

7:15 Choose Your Own Adventure : 

Algorithms Lesson:  This will we will be an introduction to Machine Learning -- week 1

White Boarding: Solving algorithms & technical problems 

Mock Interviews: Typically asked technical questions, from behavioral questions to logic and technical knowledge

Pair programming  
9:00 Attendees Depart

About Machine Learning

We'll be watching videos and discussing the concepts behind machine learning, including supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning), best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

This event is intended to be exclusively open for people who identify as women -- queer and transgender friendly.


## Other advices/suggestions

* We recommend meeting once a week.

* You can recruit outside speakers to give short presentations related to your group's focus topic and also encourage members themselves to present something new they've learned or share projects they are working on. Try to vary the level of talks from beginner to more intermediate or advanced. Keep the presentation short and informal however so the focus of the group is on self-paced study time.

* During study time, encourage members to speak up and help each other if they get stuck. Allow members to study as they wish using the materials of their choice or to work on personal projects. Members can either study independently or join the small groups to work together as they prefer.
